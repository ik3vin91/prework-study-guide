# Prework Study Guide Webpage
A study guide for course pre-work

## Description

Thank you for visiting the Prework Study Guide Website! The whole purpose of developing this webpage was to provide information to those thinking about pursuing a career in web development! While making this website, I was walked through the basics of how to build a website. From HTML, to CSS, then JavaScript. The best way to learn is by doing, so start coding!

On this website, you will find some notes I have taken on Git, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These notes are meant to help you on your path to learning how to code! If you open the DevTools console, you can see the JavaScript running. It will list the topics we learned from prework and choose one topic for you to study first.

Happy coding!
